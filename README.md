## Project overview
Developed a web application called "Blog Generator," which allows users to convert a YouTube video link into a structured article using artificial intelligence. During the creation of this application, I achieved the following goals:

- Implemented the project using Python and the Django framework.
- Organized interaction with the PostgreSQL database and stored "heavy" data in AWS Yandex Object Storage, saving links to them in the database as metadata.
- Utilized several APIs (AssemblyAI, YandexGPT, Yandex S3 Storage, Yandex Mail) to enhance the application's functionality.
- Set up Dockerfile and Docker Compose files for convenient deployment of the application.
- Ensured the stability and performance of the application using Nginx and Gunicorn.
